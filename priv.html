                    <h4>How do we protect visitor information?</h4>

                    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your
                        personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number
                        of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information
                        confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure
                        server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
                        technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.</p>

                    <h4>Do we use &quot;cookies&quot;?</h4>

                    <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer&#39;s hard
                        drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site&#39;s or service provider&#39;s
                        systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we
                        use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to
                        help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us
                        to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about
                        site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>

                    <p>We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors.
                        These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to
                        help us conduct and improve our business. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time
                        a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser
                        (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look
                        at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off,
                        you won&#39;t have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some
                        of our services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone
                        by contacting customer service.</p>
