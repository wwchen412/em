                    <h4>What information do we collect?</h4>
                    <p>
                     We collect information from you when you register on the site, place an order, enter a contest or sweepstakes, respond to
                    a survey or communication such as e-mail, or participate in another site feature.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                         When ordering or registering, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information
                        or other information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>We also collect information about gift recipients so that we can fulfill the gift purchase. The information we collect about
                    gift recipients is not used for marketing purposes.</p>
                    <p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits to our websites.
                    Please refer to the "Do we use 'cookies'?" section below for information about cookies and how we use them.</p>
                    <p>How do we use your information? We may use the information we collect from you when you register, purchase products, enter
                    a contest or promotion, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features
                    in the following ways:</p>
                    <p>
                         To personalize your site experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are
                        most interested. To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests. To quickly process your
                        transactions. To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you have opted-in to receive our e-mail newsletter, we may send you periodic e-mails. If you would no longer like to receive
                    promotional e-mail from us, please refer to the "How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have provided to us?"
                    section below. If you have not opted-in to receive e-mail newsletters, you will not receive these e-mails. Visitors who register
                    or participate in other site features such as marketing programs and 'members-only' content will be given a choice whether
                    they would like to be on our e-mail list and receive e-mail communications from us.</p>
                    <h4> How do we protect visitor information?</h4>
                    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information
                    is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights
                    to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information,
                    we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
                    technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.</p>
                    <h4>Do we use "cookies"?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web
                    browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember
                    certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are
                    also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide
                    you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction
                    so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
